## What is Ray Tracing

In order to define the ray tracing, we need to define what is 'Ray'.
The `Ray` is defined by two things, it has origin in some point in space (xyz) and a direction.

`Ray Casting` is taking the idea of taking that ray and shooting it out in that direction and finding
what gets hit.
